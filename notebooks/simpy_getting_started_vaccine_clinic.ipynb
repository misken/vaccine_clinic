    "# Using discrete event simulation to help plan a vaccine clinic\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete event simulation (DES) is a well established technique for building simulation models of systems characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* events that happen at discrete points in time (e.g. the arrival of a patient to the vaccine clinic, the completion of the vaccine injection),\n",
    "* uncertainty in the timing and duration of events (patient show up somewhat randomly even if they have a scheduled appointment, the time to register might depend on various patient characteristics),\n",
    "* entities (e.g. patients) that flow through a system, \n",
    "* contention for resources (patients will wait to at various stages of their vaccine visit to wait for resources such as administrative and clinical staff to become available)\n",
    "* interest in how the system is performing in terms of things like entity delays, resource utilization, or frequency of certain events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical applications include building models of healtchare delivery systems, manufacturing systems, computer networks, call centers and other service systems, and many others. In all of these systems there are entities that flow (patients, widgets, packets, phone calls) and contend for resources for processing (nurses to give vaccines, machines to process, servers to accept packets, agents to answer the phone). By building a representative simulation model, we can study how such systems might perform if we changes some important entity or resource related inputs: patient arrival rate, machine processing rate, number of servers or number of agents answering calls). The applications are endless and it can be a whole lot cheaper to experiment with a computer model than to experiment with the real system.\n",
    "\n",
    "DES models are \"what if?\" models that can help in predicting outputs of a system for a given set of input values. They can help statistically characterize the projected performance of the system being modeled. For example, we might simulate different assembly line configurations to get a sense of the throughput differences for different processes. Or, for a call center they could help predict the impact on customer wait time of a 25% increase in call volume. \n",

    "\n",
    "> SimPy is a discrete-event simulation library. The behavior of active components (like vehicles, customers or messages) is modeled with processes. All processes live in an environment. They interact with the environment and with each other via events.\n",

    "* a random arrival process\n",
    "* a multi-stage process in which we have to contend for limited resources at each stage,\n",
    "* there is uncertainty in some of the processing times,\n",
    "* we are interested in things like the relationship between patient volume, resource utilization and patient waiting. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a model that will be helpful in deciding how many vaccination stations to have, the hours of operation of the vaccine clinic, and the size of the post-vaccine waiting room needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the SimPy in 10 Minutes tutorial, I will start with the very basics and keep adding on functionality and complexity. Along the way, I'll try to give you a bit of sense of how SimPy works. Start by reading the [Basic Concepts section of the SimPyin 10 tutorial](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/basic_concepts.html#basic-concepts) to start to become familiar with some fundamental SimPy concepts:\n",

Recall that generators are a special type of function (or method) that acts as an iterator and that remembers its state between calls to it. We also say that generator functions are *lazy iterators*.  They are lazy in the sense that they don't generate their values until asked to do so. For example, consider using a list comprehension to generate the first 10 perfect squares."

It also, temporarily, passes control back to whomever called. Since it can remember its `state`, it knows where it left off whenever the function is called again using `next`. No need to generate new values until asked. You might have realized that `perfect_squares_gen_1` is really just some syntactic sugar for doing what we did in `perfect_squares_gen_2`.\n",

The most common such event is a `Timeout` event - it gets triggered when a specified duration of time has passed on the simulation clock. Some additional resources on generators include:\n",

Within these choices there are many different ways to go about developing the details of the model. Even though SimPy has been around for several years, best practices for modeling are still evolving. In addition, things that come as standard features in many commercial simulation packages such as statistical monitoring and animation, are the responsibility of the modeler when using SimPy.

It would be nice to know when each patient was created to make sure things are working correctly. SimPy has functions for accessing the state of the simulation clock - the current simulation time is accessible from the `now` attribute of the simulation environment object (which by convention we usually name `env`. We'll include `print` statements to help illustrate what is going in inside the function."

    "Let's extend the model a bit by adding a simple delay process. In other words, let's pretend that after a patient arrives, the patient spends a random amount of time to go through all the stages of the vaccination process. In other words we are grossly oversimplifying the real system by ignorning all the details of the vaccination process. Let's model this total time in the vaccination clinic with another exponential distribution having a mean of 20 minutes.\n",
