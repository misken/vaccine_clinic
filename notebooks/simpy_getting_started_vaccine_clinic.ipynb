    "# Using discrete event simulation to help plan a vaccine clinic\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete event simulation (DES) is a well established technique for building simulation models of systems characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* events that happen at discrete points in time (e.g. the arrival of a patient to the vaccine clinic, the completion of the vaccine injection),\n",
    "* uncertainty in the timing and duration of events (patient show up somewhat randomly even if they have a scheduled appointment, the time to register might depend on various patient characteristics),\n",
    "* entities (e.g. patients) that flow through a system, \n",
    "* contention for resources (patients will wait to at various stages of their vaccine visit to wait for resources such as administrative and clinical staff to become available)\n",
    "* interest in how the system is performing in terms of things like entity delays, resource utilization, or frequency of certain events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical applications include building models of healtchare delivery systems, manufacturing systems, computer networks, call centers and other service systems, and many others. In all of these systems there are entities that flow (patients, widgets, packets, phone calls) and contend for resources for processing (nurses to give vaccines, machines to process, servers to accept packets, agents to answer the phone). By building a representative simulation model, we can study how such systems might perform if we changes some important entity or resource related inputs: patient arrival rate, machine processing rate, number of servers or number of agents answering calls. The applications are endless and it can be a whole lot cheaper to experiment with a computer model than to experiment with the real system.\n",
    "\n",
    "DES models are \"what if?\" models that can help in predicting outputs of a system for a given set of input values. They can help statistically characterize the projected performance of the system being modeled. For example, we might simulate different assembly line configurations to get a sense of the throughput differences for different processes. Or, for a call center they could help predict the impact on customer wait time of a 25% increase in call volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the pcda class, we built a simple simulation model of the Monte-Hall 3-Door problem which allowed us to compare the success of different strategies such as staying with the original door selected vs switching. For that model we didn't need a specialized discrete event package since we were just modeling a sequence of events with the time between them being unimportant. Furthermore, there was no contention for resources. If you want to review that model, see the downloads and screencasts on [this page from the pcda courseweb](http://www.sba.oakland.edu/faculty/isken/courses/mis5470_w21/python_intro_2.html) (just scroll down to find info about the problem and links to the screencasts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, our goal in this module is to develop a DES model model of a simple vaccine clinic consisting of the following process steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Arrival --> Temperature check --> Registration --> Vaccination --> Schedule 2nd dose (if needed) --> Wait 15 minutes --> Exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, our model has the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The entities are patients.\n",
    "* Entities are created by some sort of arrival process.\n",
    "* Each stage of the process has some number of resources associated with it. These resources are the staff that help the patient such as registration clerks and clinicians administrering the vaccine.\n",
    "* Entities flow through different stages of the vaccination process, and at each stage, they:\n",
    "    - request one unit of the appropriate type of staff resource and wait if one is not available,\n",
    "    - after obtaining a staff resource they delay for some amount of time for the process (e.g. registration, vaccination, scheduling) to be completed,\n",
    "    - when the processing time has elapsed, the resource is released and the patient moves on to the next stage of the vaccination process,\n",
    "* When all stages are complete, the patient exits the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model should handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "* uncertainty in the processing times of the individual steps above,\n",
    "* uncertainty in patient arrival times\n",
    "* finite numbers of different types of resources (staff)\n",
    "* ability to estimate key process metrics such as patient wait times and total time in clinic as well as resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a model would be quite useful in helping do capacity planning and appointment scheduling for the clinic. We need to decide how many staff are needed at each stage of the clinic visit and how much room we need in the post-vaccination patient observation area.\n",

The most common such event is a `Timeout` event - it gets triggered when a specified duration of time has passed on the simulation clock. A `Timeout` event could be used to model something like the time it takes for a patient to get registered at our clinic. We will also use `yield` when we need to acquire a resource such as the clinician who will vaccinate the patient.

Unfortunately, SimPy no longer has built in *monitor* classes to track these things. So, we'll do it ourselves. In order to correctly compute time averaged occupancy statistics, we just need to log the time and occupancy level each time it changes. For example, when a patient acquires a staff member to administer the vaccination, the occupancy in the vaccination stage increases by 1. When the vaccination is complete and the patient releases the resource, the occupancy decreases by 1.\n",
